/**
 * So what we have here is our higher level class RoboPub depending on our low level, concrete classes
 * WineBot and BeerBot, causing this class to violate the Dependency Inversion Principle. In addition to this,
 * dispenseBeer and dispenseWine are details coupled with their classes, meaning that we'd need to change this before
 * we add an abstraction. What if we want our pub to have robots that dispense other drinks? In its current state,
 * we‚Äôd have to change the RoboPub class, which violates the Open-Closed Principle.
